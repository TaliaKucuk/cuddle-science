<h3 id="five-reasons">5 Reasons Why Cuddles Feel So Good!</h3>
<p><ul id="reasons">
  <li><strong>Boosts oxytocin</strong><br>

Physical touch like cuddling increases oxytocin (the “bonding hormone”), which helps people feel safe, connected, and emotionally bonded.
    Oxytocin is strongly linked to trust and attachment.<br><br> 
<li><strong>Reduces stress and cortisol levels</strong><br>

Cuddling has been shown to lower cortisol, the hormone associated with stress.
Lower cortisol = calmer nervous system.<br><br>
<li><strong>Can lower blood pressure and heart rate</strong><br>

Studies show affectionate touch can reduce blood pressure and heart rate, which supports heart health over time.<br><br><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/c0/72/5a/c0725a6683aeadcd3bcff390d1dfb288.jpg"
